HTML = creates the content
CSS = changes the appearance
JavaScript = makes it interactive

what is javascript ???
-> a technology that we use to create websites.
- giving instructions to a computer [ code ]
- the computer follows our instructions [ running the code ]

Syntax
- rules that we have to follow when using 
  a programming language
- similar to english ( grammar )
- in programming, we have to follow the rules 
  fo  syntax exactly.


Order of operations

2 - 2  --|
2 + 2    | --- Operations
2 * 2    |     characters in the middle are called [operators]
2 / 2  --|

* / - are done first
- + - are done after (order precedence)

* / have same priority
2 * 3 / 5 then calculate from the left to right same for + -

In programming,
2, 3, 4 = integers
2.23, 2.5 = floats

- computers have a problem working with floats.
How do we avoid this problem?
- Best practices when calculating money
= calculate in  cents instead of dollars

Calculations with floats are sometimes inaccurate.
- When working with money
1. Do the calculations in cents
2. Convert back to dollars.

Strings also follow the order of operations.
\" = double quote that is just text
\n = newline character

3 ways to create a string:
1. '....'
2. "...."
3. `....` = template strings
interpolation = insert value directly into the a string
${} = insert value directly into string


What should we use to create string ?
1. Use '...' by default.
2. If we need interpolation, multi-line strings
   use `...`.
  

What is a function ??
Ans. A function lets us reuse code.

Rules for Parameter Names
1. Can't use special words.
   Example: function
2. Can't start with a number.
3. Can't use special characters
   except: $_
Best practice = use camelCase


Bracket Notation
- lets us use properties that don't work 
  with dot notation.


JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
- a syntax
- similar to JavaScript objects
- but with less features
We use JSON
- when we send data between computers
- when we store data

Built-in JSON Object:
Convert:
JavaScript Object(parse) <----> JSON(stringify)

document.querySelector() 
- let us get any element from the page and put it inside JavaScript.
class attribute = adds a label

DOM combines JS and HTML together
It gives JS full control of the webpage.

clicks, keydowns => events
onclick, onkeydown => event-listeners

Order of operations

2 - 2  --|
2 + 2    | --- Operations
2 * 2    |     characters in the middle are called [operators]
2 / 2  --|

* / - are done first
- + - are done after (order precedence)

* / have same priority
2 * 3 / 5 then calculate from the left to right same for + -

In programming,
2, 3, 4 = integers
2.23, 2.5 = floats

- computers have a problem working with floats.
How do we avoid this problem?
- Best practices when calculating money
= calculate in  cents instead of dollars

Calculations with floats are sometimes inaccurate.
- When working with money
1. Do the calculations in cents
2. Convert back to dollars.
